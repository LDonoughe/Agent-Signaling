This is the code portion of a undergraduate thesis investigating the combination of two topics in Game Theory: ESS and Signalling. 

basic-model contains the original model specification.

asymmetric-payoffs contains the same model with the (payoff) variables altered and serves as a staging ground to test the impact of those changes.

follow-the-leader contains the original model with a change in the implementation of the genetic algorithm to only emulate the most profitable firm rather then any firm not in the bottom three

To Run:
Install FLAME and pre-reqs (limboard and xparser)

if you wish, you can (re)generate 0.xml with generate_0th_iteration.rb

(from xparser install location)
run xparser on agent_model.xml

(from basic-model)
make [limboard path]

main [num of iterations] 0.xml
